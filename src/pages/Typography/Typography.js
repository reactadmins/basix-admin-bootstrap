                The unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most
                familiar to people. They occur in a variety of habitats, such as

                various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra

                lthough zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not
                interbreed. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with

                      Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they
                      can see in color. Like most ungulates, the zebra's eyes
                      are on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of
                      view.
