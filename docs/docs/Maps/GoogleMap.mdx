Google Maps is a web mapping service that provides high-quality and detailed maps, satellite imagery, street view, directions, and more. Google Maps also offers various APIs and libraries that allow you to customize and enhance your maps with markers, shapes, layers, controls, and events.
To use Google Maps in your React application, you need to integrate the Google Maps API and obtain an API key. You can follow the steps in the official documentation (https://developers.google.com/maps/) to get started.

You can find the Google Maps components in the `src/views/GoogleMaps` folder.
