# Installation
To use Basix Admin, you need to have React 18+, Node.js, and NPM installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the template:
- Clone or download the repository from GitHub
- Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Run `npm run build` to build the project
- Run `npm run preview` to preview the project
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173/
You should see the Basix Admin Template on your screen. You can explore the different pages and components, and customize them according to your needs. To build the production version of the template, run `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder with the optimized files. To serve the production version, run `npm run preview` and go to http://localhost:4173/ again.

Run with NPM

```
npm install
```

then run
```
npm run dev
```
Navigate to http://localhost:5173/

to build

```
npm run build
```
and run
```
npm run serve
```
